# Stats220
## What is the purpose of this repo?
1. To manage **projects** in Stats220.
  * This includes all relevant files that are used in projects.
2. As an opportunity to get started in the realm of github.
  * As you can tell, this is my very first repo ever in github. I believe this is the perfect opportunity for me to capitalise on making this into a standard practice into my life and getting used to how github works.
3. Most importantly, this repo allows me to track my progress in University and then into my career!
  *In a way, it's almost like a journal of some sort.
